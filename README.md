# tinyAVR-i2c
This is a simple blocking I2C library for the series-1 / series-2 tinyavr chips.

Its function signature and functionally compatible with peter fleury's library for the older attiny chips at http://www.peterfleury.epizy.com/avr-software.html#libs

The code has not been tested yet as i dont have hardware, so don't use this for now.
